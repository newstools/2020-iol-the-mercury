Durban - A 4-year-old died after a house caught alight in Osizweni, Newcastle, on Sunday. Ward councillor Skhumbuzo Nhlapho said the child was allegedly left in the house with an elder sibling when the mother went to work. It is believed the child was left alone in the house by the sibling. He said the community did not know what led to the fire breaking out, but suspected the heater that had been left on may have been the cause. Community members who were first at the scene did all they could to extinguish the fire. “To see someone burning in front of your eyes while you try to put out the fire is heartbreaking. People were crying while trying to extinguish the fire,” he said. “When I got the call, I rushed there and found the mother of the child was devastated. I tried to speak to them; they are very hurt and disturbed,” said Nhlapho. Provincial police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that an inquest docket was being investigated by Osizweni SAPS. KZN MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Sipho Hlomuka said he had deployed disaster management officials to support the family and probe the cause of the fire. He urged residents to be vigilant and not leave appliances such as heaters unattended, especially with children present. The Mercury
