Durban – Carrington Heights residents have expressed their frustration that thousands of litres of water have been leaking from a damaged pipe into the road for months despite their repeated complaints to the eThekwini Municipality to fix the problem. Resident Rosie Sara said she had reported the leak to the municipality telephonically more than three months ago, yet it had not been repaired. “It’s been leaking like that for months. It has got around the manholes and it is bubbling up and we can hear water running down the drain on the side of the road. “I reported it to the municipality and they said they would send somebody out but they have never done so,” she said. “There are so many people who have no water, it’s frustrating. They are letting this water run here and they are just wasting it. Others in our community group have also reported it,” she said. Resident Dina Daniels said she had reported the leak on two occasions. “It was reported four months ago and almost every household in the road has reported it and it was reported to the local councillor and nothing has changed,” Daniels said. Another resident, who asked not to be named, said she had reported the leak to the municipality four times, but nothing had been done. EThekwini Municipality’s spokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela, said the City did not have a record of the leak being reported. He said the fault had now been captured. “A plumber has been dispatched to the area,” he said. He urged residents to continue reporting illegal water connections and water leaks to the number 080 1313013 or via the municipality’s WhatsApp Water Reporting Line number: 073 148 3477.
