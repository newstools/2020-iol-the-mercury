Durban - EThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda has urged the community to work with law-enforcement agencies to curb crime in the KwaZulu-Natal hot spot areas of Inanda and uMlazi. Kaunda was speaking during the second leg of an eThekwini crime webinar at the weekend that focused on tackling crime in Inanda. The webinar included management of the police in the eThekwini cluster, the Department of Community Safety and Liaison, community crime-fighting structures and various civil society organisations. The mayor said community members should close ranks with the police to defeat the scourge of crime, particularly gender-based violence. The latest crime statistics revealed that Inanda remained the township with the highest rate of sexual offences in the country, followed by uMlazi. Kaunda called on police management to distribute resources where they were most needed and improve the efficiency of satellite police stations in Amaoti and Vela in Inanda Newtown C and A. “We have also agreed that police must conduct intelligence-driven operations and raid illegal liquor outlets operating 24 hours. We must also commend the police for fast-tracking the process to expand the informer networks in the community to assist the police to identify wanted suspects and to rid the area of illegal firearms.” He said for the municipality to effectively deal with crime, they should address poverty and unemployment. For this reason, he said, the municipality had taken a decision to provide more opportunities to co-operatives at a community level. To ensure that the resolutions taken were implemented, Kaunda committed to reconvene the meeting in November to assess the progress made in eradicating crime in Inanda. “We want our operations to concentrate on crime hot spots, particularly in Amaoti, Bhambayi and Ezimamgweni,” he said. Crime in Inanda is at an all-time high, particularly rape and taxi violence, which has seen commuters being killed. The Mercury
