Durban - Eskom has warned that the power system is severely constrained and could lead to loadshedding at short notice. On Monday, the power giant urged the public to reduce electricity usage due a constrained power system. In a statement issued on Monday afternoon, Eskom said the return of one generation unit had been delayed, while another two units had tripped earlier in the day. "One of the tripped units has returned while Eskom teams are working hard to return as many of these generation units to service as possible, any further deterioration in the generation performance may necessitate the implementation of loadshedding at short notice," the statement read. Eskom said as the aged generation infrastructure was unreliable and volatile, this constrained power system is expected to persist for the rest of the week. "The return of a unit each at Majuba and Medupi power stations has been delayed. A unit each at the Tutuka and Hendrina power stations tripped earlier today. This adds to further breakdowns at the Tutuka, Majuba, Komati, Kendal and Hendrina power stations. These unplanned breakdowns contributed to the more than 11 000MW of capacity, adding to the 4 658MW currently out on planned maintenance," Eskom said. Last week, Eskom announced that it had to implement Stage 2 loadshedding. It was called off on Friday. The Mercury
