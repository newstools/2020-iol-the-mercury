A man believed to be an e-hailing driver was shot multiple times during an alleged carjacking in Bellair on Wednesday afternoon. Reports on Facebook crime groups suggested that an e-hailing driver was shot in the neck and face during a carjacking incident on Kenmare Road, Bellair, and the car crashed into a wall before 12pm. Rescue Care spokesperson Rowen Scandroglio said paramedics responded to the scene of the shooting and found a man believed to be in his 30s in a critical condition. He had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to his body. “He was in a critical condition and was stabilised by Advanced Life Support Paramedics on the scene before he was rushed through to a Durban hospital for the further care that he required,” said Scandroglio. He added that events leading up to the shooting were unknown but police were at the scene and were investigating. Bellair Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Malcolm Naidoo said the incident was e-hailing related, an attempted carjacking and shooting. Naidoo thought the driver of a white Polo sedan must have refused to hand his vehicle over and was shot before the suspects fled on foot. He said it did not seem like an opportunistic carjacking because criminals used the same modus operandi when carjacking e-hailing vehicles. “They hail a vehicle from one area, bring it to another area and when they are on a quiet road, they basically pull out a gun and ask the driver to get off or take the driver with the vehicle,” said Naidoo. He was unsure about the vehicle crashing into a wall but it might have happened when the suspects pulled out the gun, the driver refusing to give up the vehicle or when he was shot. Naidoo said carjacking attempts on e-hailing was common over the past year, where vehicles were brought in from other areas and the carjacking would happen in Bellair but it had been quiet over the past few months. Police had not commented by the time of publication. Daily News
