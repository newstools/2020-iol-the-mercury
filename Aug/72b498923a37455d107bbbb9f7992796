Speaking at the release of the UNDP's Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of Covid-19 on South Africa, Mkhize said SA was beyond the inflection point.

"With 82% of recoveries nationally and some provinces showing 90% recoveries, it is very positive. Therefore it is the right time to start considering what needs to be done as we move towards a risk-adjusted approach towards normality,"  he said. On Tuesday, the country was officially downgraded to level 2 of the national lockdown which was implemented in March this year.
