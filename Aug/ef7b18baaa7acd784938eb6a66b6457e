Let’s face it - no two homes are the same and as windows come in various shapes and sizes, it can be challenging to find ready-made curtains that fit properly. Your style directs how you’ll want curtains to look in a specific room. No matter which look you prefer, curtains finish off a room  and will look incomplete without them. So, why not get the curtains you envision? Even if it means you’ll have to spend a little more than anticipated, there’s no reason you have to buy curtains off the shelf if you can’t find something you like. If your home is bursting with character, off-the-shelf curtains simply won’t give you the desired finish. At Curtain Master, we make sure your curtains work with your design and fit perfectly on your windows. It’s vital that the colours co-ordinate and often you simply can’t  find the right curtains off the shelf. You can spend hours trying to find something at least half-decent but to no avail. That’s where we come in. We can make your vision a reality and know where to find the perfect textiles for your curtains. Curtain Master is a curtain manufacturer in Durban.
