By Thulasizwe Nkomo Durban - The KZN Music Imbizo said this year’s conference would be held virtually with hundreds of national and international music experts, organisers, label owners and musicians expected to engage on critical music and business-related topics. The event will be held online from tomorrow to Saturday. The KZN Music Imbizo said: “The conference programme will address issues in the music industry: the protection of intellectual property; doing business in the continent; music and brand associations and streaming.” The imbizo’s project manager, Sphe Mbhele, said because of Covid-19 restrictions this year’s event would be different. “We have pulled in big names and many industry participants worldwide who have agreed to be part of the conferences since they will be giving maybe an hour or two of their time, which would have been unlikely if everyone were to come here to Durban,” said Mbhele. Mbhele said with their theme being African Unity - The Real Currency, the objective of this year’s event was to start a conversation on how to collaborate and start a music business in Africa. “Our theme communicates the importance of unity within the continent and how that is our gold,” he said “We are excited and pleased that so many influential leaders from the global music industry already committed to participate at The Virtual Music Imbizo 2020.” For more information about the imbizo go to www.themusicimbizo.co.za The Mercury
