TOKYO - Japan's Kei Nishikori said on Wednesday he had tested negative for Covid-19 after testing positive twice this month but he has decided to skip the US Open anyway. The 30-year-old, a finalist at Flushing Meadows in 2014, withdrew from the Western & Southern Open hardcourt event after his first positive test, casting doubt over his participation in the Grand Slam tournament which starts on Monday. "I am happy to announce that I tested negative for Covid. I will slowly pick up my practice schedule tomorrow," the former world number four said on his website. "Having said that, I (together with my team) have decided to skip the U.S. Open this year. After such a long break I feel that returning in a best of five long-match setting is not smart until I am fully ready to do so," Nishikori, the world number 31, added.
