Thulasizwe Nkomo Durban - A 36-year-old man appeared in the Estcourt Magistrate’s Court after he was arrested on Friday for the murder of his 3-year-old child. According to KwaZulu- Natal National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara, the accused, Themba Majozi, has been charged with murder and possession of human tissue. “The matter was postponed to December 2 for the accused to undergo a preliminary mental observation,” said Ramkisson-Kara. According to the police, the child was left in the care of her grandmother when the suspect came and took the child on November 26. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said when the grandmother returned from work she noticed that the child was not at home. When the suspect was questioned about the whereabouts of the child, he became violent, she said. “Family members decided to search for the missing child. At 2pm, the child was found in the bushes with a nail inserted into his skull and mutilated. “The police were immediately alerted and responded to the scene. “A 36-year-old man was then placed under arrest for murder after the missing body parts were found inside the suspect’s house,” said Gwala. The accused’s father, Mndeni Majozi, said his son lived near his workplace and his grandson lived with them. The child’s mother lives in KwaMaphumulo. Majozi sr described his son as a good man who conducted himself well and loved his child. “He is now crazy or has been possessed by some evil spirit which we don’t know where it came from.” He said even during his court appearance, his son was not himself and that’s why mental observation was ordered. Ward councillor in the area, Simon Mchunu, said the community was shocked at what had happened in the Majozi household. “The community is in deep shock, especially because an incident like this is unusual and has never happened before in the area,” said Mchunu.
