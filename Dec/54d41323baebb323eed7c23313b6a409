Police have opened an inquest docket after a six-month-old boy was found dead in his cot in Verulam on Monday. Private security company, Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa), said in a statement that its paramedics had been called to a house in Verulam. Rusa said the baby was declared dead shortly after 10:49am.
