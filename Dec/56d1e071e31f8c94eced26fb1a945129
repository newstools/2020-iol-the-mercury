The leaking of another matric exam paper is to say the least a shocking indication of the operational standards and the security levels that the Education Department has in place. It sounds like the rot of corruption of the various state enterprises is now also happening in the Education Department where there are those getting on the bandwagon of making money for themselves Another indication of the fact that the ANC-appointed comrades have no managerial skills at all. Just now our education system will be the most laughed at when compared to others and will be worth nothing as the majority of the population after matriculating can hardly communicate properly or even write a proper composition. Just listen to SAFM when callers call in –every fifth word is “You know” and “So” – even the presenters themselves seem to think that this is acceptable. Makes one think where we are indeed heading to. Glen Christie, Durban North
