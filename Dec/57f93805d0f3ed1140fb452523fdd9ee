OUR public servants suffer from hubris and are highly insensitive and irresponsible during this time of the pandemic. They suffered no financial  loss, whilst millions in the private sector took the biggest hit. Many suffered decreased income and millions lost their jobs when we started the lockdown in March. Up to now 11 million South Africans are unemployed. The private sector employees suffered the most. The public servants live in clover, some 1.4 million of them. Now the public servants want their increase and they have gone to the Labour Court to enforce the 3 year multi-layered wage agreement. It’s a increase the government can’t afford as set out in Finance Minister Tito  Mboweni’s affidavit. One has to support the finance minister as it clearly spelt out the fiscus can’t afford it. Whilst millions go hungry the taxpayers have to pander to whims and fancies of the 2 percent of the population that are in public service. Shame on the PSA for being such a selfish union who can’t seem to see the wood for the trees. One trusts that the Labour Court will slap down their irresponsible request for an “enforcement order” as regards the increases.
