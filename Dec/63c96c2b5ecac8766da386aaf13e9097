Authorities have closed a number of roads in the vicinity of Otto Volek Road in New Germany, outside Pinetown following a massive fire at a chemical factory on Tuesday morning Durban metro police are diverting traffic to other routes. Traffic has backed up and motorists have been warned to avoid the area. According to ALS Paramedics, the incident took place just after 11am on Tuesday. ALS paramedic Gareth Jamieson said that several emergency teams were on the scene and a number of people were evacuated from the area. A plume of smoke is moving towards the Pinetown CBD and can be seen from a distance. Surrounding factories have been closed because the fire may spread due to the wind. Jamieson said 13 people were injured in the fire. "At this stage, the latest update is that 13 people have been transported to hospital for various injuries. The fire department has multiple units on scene to fight the fire. However, the strong winds are making it rather difficult." According to the police at the scene, it is unknown at this stage what caused the explosion.
