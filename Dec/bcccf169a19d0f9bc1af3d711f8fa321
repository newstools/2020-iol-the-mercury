Durban - In commemoration of International Day of Disabled Persons, Lotus FM DJ Varshan Sookhun presented the Lunch Break show in a wheelchair to show solidarity with the physically disabled. Startup non-profit organisation Nokusa Support for Disabled People challenged Sookhun to do his three-hour show in a wheelchair. Nokusa founder Menzi Nxumalo said it was important for people with physical disabilities to identify and develop their abilities. “The aim was to show disabled people (wheelchair-bound) that yes the legs may not work but your hands and mind work, so nothing is stopping you from following your dreams,” he said. Nxumalo said Sookhun was an ideal candidate for the 2020 challenge because he was popular among the young and old. “For him to take up this challenge, it will educate many people about disability in rural communities and township areas,” he said. In a video posted on the station’s social media page, Sookhun said he accepted the challenge to show his support for people with physical disabilities. “Wheelchair users are faced with challenges daily, a major one is that of accessibility. “Some buildings may not be wheelchair friendly and parking spaces designated for the physically challenged are taken up by able-bodied people,” said Sookhun. Sookhun appealed to the public to show courtesy to people with disabilities. “Show some courtesy, show your support, respect, and understand the needs of people who have physical disabilities,” he said.
