Cape Town - There will be no load shedding on Wednesday, embattled power utility Eskom said in an early morning statement.
It however warned that while there has been some improvement, load shedding could be implemented on short notice. 

"Unplanned outages or breakdowns were at 10 456 MW at 5:30m this morning."
The power utility will communicate if there is any change and provide a prognosis for Thursday, later today.
Eskom said it had stopped load shedding at 21:00 on Tuesday.

"While the system remains vulnerable, several units have successfully returned today as planned and good progress has been made in replenishing emergency reserves. Unplanned outages or breakdowns were at 10 521MW as at 16:30 this afternoon," said Eskom in a statement released on Tuesday. 
Eskom also reminded South Africans that there is a possibility of increased loadshedding over the next 18 months, as it is conducting "critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health".     
The struggling power utility has once again urged citizens to electricity sparingly and to reduce demand during this period.
