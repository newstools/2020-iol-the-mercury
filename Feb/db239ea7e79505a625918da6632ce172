Durban - Durban snake catcher Nick Evans has reiterated that pouring Jeyes Fluid around your home will not keep snakes out. 
 

 He shared this information after he was called to a home in Inanda to rescue a 'grumpy' 1,5 metre black mamba. 

 

 "When I arrived at the home I found that there was 
 large amounts of Jeyes Fluid poured in the house. It's a misconception, Jeyes Fluid d
 oes not work in keeping snakes away. If it did, that snake would have been a million miles away.

 

 "There is nothing that works. 
 The best thing you can do is start keeping your yard neat and tidy. 
 Rubbish attracts rats and thereafter snakes."

 
  
   
  
  
   
    Speaking about the rescue, Evans said a man and his young child were washing something outside when the mamba went past them. 
   
   
    
   
   
    "The mamba didn't try and bite them, it had no interest in biting them. However when people noticed the snake and started screaming the snake darted towards one of the homes."
   
   
    
   
   
    Evans said when he arrived he found a large rat in the house. 
   
   
    
   
   
    "When I moved the
     cabinet I also found a bunch of cockroaches among the mamba. 
   
   
    
   
   
    "It was a big mamba and had a piece of its tail missing either an attack by a predator or a human. 
   
   
    
   
   
    "It was a very powerful snake, she was not happy about being grabbed and manhandled and quite grumpy. 
   
   
    
   
   
    "But we caught the snake and the people were quite nice and grateful," said Evans. 
   
   
    
   
   
    He said that snake season would not die down especially in Durban because of the weather.
