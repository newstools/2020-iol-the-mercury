Durban - It has been a busy time for Durban snake catcher Nick Evans, who rescued three snakes in just one day.
Evans said this week he rescued at least seven snakes from areas around Durban. Since Saturday, he found two Mozambican spitting cobras and five black mambas.

One black mamba was caught in a bedroom.
‚ÄúI received three calls on Monday, one from a family in the upper Highway area where a 1.5m black mamba was found in a bedroom, seeking refuge under the bed. 
‚ÄúI also got a call from a family in Bellair about a black mamba in their storeroom. Another call was from a family in Newlands West.‚Äù

He said that with the hot summer temperatures, the sightings of snakes at Durban homes became more frequent. Two black mambas and the spitting cobras were captured on Saturday.
Evans appealed to people to call a snake catcher instead of killing snakes.
‚ÄúIn some rural areas, residents are not aware that there is help. 

‚ÄúThey should call for help not just for the safety of the snake, but for their own safety.‚Äù
Snake catchers are listed online. 
‚ÄúIt is extremely dangerous to kill snakes such as mambas and cobras. The snakes don‚Äôt want to bite or attack, but if they are threatened and escape is not an option, they will defend themselves,‚Äù Evans warned.

He said venomous snakes found along coastal areas included black and green mambas, Mozambican spitting cobras and rhombic night adders.

   Second Black Mamba call of the day! This was the fourth (second catch of the day) in Newlands West (Durban), bordering a beautiful valley. It slithered into this storeroom and gave all the residents a fright- imagine how the snake felt! A nice long specimen, but worryingly underweight. It's going to need some TLC before release. #blackmamba #mambas #dendroaspispolylepis #venomous #venomoussnakes #durban #southafrica #africa #onlyinafrica #kzn #reptiles #reptilesofinstagram #conservation #wildlife #monday #mondaymotivation #animalsofinstagram #nature #summer #heat #hotsummer

   Yesterday I caught my first cobra of the new decade, and last night came my first mamba of the new decade! :D A Black Mamba had been seen slithering behind an oven, down in the Inanda Valley. "Never before in my life, have I seen a snake this big with my naked eyes", said the caller. He considered killing it but said it was too scary to do so, thankfully! The caller and his mate ran about 500m through the bush, up a steep slope, to meet us on the road, with no torch! It was a very bumpy drive to the house. The mamba was a feisty one, constantly moving behind one cupboard to another. We had some very intoxicated onlookers, who I was more worried about than the snake. After giving us the run around, we eventually got it! It's a beautiful specimen, a nice grey color and very healthy! Not a giant mamba, but a decent size nonetheless. #snakeconservation #snakes #snakesofinstagram #snakesofig #blackmamba #mambas #dendroaspispolylepis #venomous #venomoussnakes #durban #southafrica #africa #onlyinafrica #kzn #reptiles #reptilesofinstagram #conservation #inanda #summer #2020 #newyear #newdecade #wildlife #community

   First cobra of the decade! Quite entertaining too. The snake was discovered in the lounge by a dog, who thankfully avoided being spat at. I arrived to find one of the residents sitting on a chair, just out of Spitting zone, with safety glasses on, waving a duster at the snake to keep it occupied until I arrivedüòÇüòÇüòÇ But really nice people, and a pleasure to help. Decent sized snake, about 1.1-1.2m. #snakeconservation #snakes #snakesofinstagram #snakesofig #mozambiquespittingcobra #najamossambica #naja #cobra #shongweni #durban #kzn #SouthAfrica #africa #onlyinafrica #reptiles #reptilesofinstagram #summer #jamuary #2020 #happynewyear
