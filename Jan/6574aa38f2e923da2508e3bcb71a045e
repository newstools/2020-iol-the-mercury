    On Sunday afternoon, four male teenagers had 
    attempted to cross the Blue Lagoon Estuary when one of the four teens got into difficulty and was washed out to the sea by a strong flowing current. 
   
   
    
   
   
    According to Sewpersad, 
    a initial surf and shore search was performed by 
    Metro Police Search and Rescue, SAPS Search and Rescue, Ethekwini lifeguards and Life Response 24. However, 
    due to unfavorable sea conditions and failing light, the search was called off. 
   
   
    
   
   
    On New Year's day, a 20-year-old male drowned while swimming at an unprotected beach at Salt Rock. 
   
   
    
   
   
    Paul Herbst from IPSS Medical Rescue said paramedics and crews attempted to resuscitate the patient however efforts were unsuccessful. 
   
   
    
   
   
    He urged people to swim at protected beaches only.
