Global superstar, BeyoncÃ© is dropping her new Ivy Park collection with adidas and we're so envious.Â

 However, a select group of celebrities have already received PR packages from the Queen Bey.

 And like rest of us, the BeyHive wished their Queen Bey could send them the collection as well but hey, only the chosen ones received it and the rest of us must wait for the 18th and buy it. Even if we are in the middle of 
 Januworry.

 

 Here are some of the most hilarious reactions from those who want the collection, but can't seem to afford it.
