"The complainant managed to reverse and drove off and the suspects fled."
 Gwala said a case of attempted carjacking was opened in the Montclair SAPS for investigation. 
 She confirmed the video of the incident went viral on social media.   Gwala said an intelligence driven operation was conducted which led to the arrest of a 20-year-old suspect who was in possession of a firearm and a 33-year-old suspect. 

 "They were both arrested in Lamontville and charged for attempted carjacking whereas a 20-year-old suspect was also charged for possession of unlicensed firearm."
 She said the  33-year-old suspect has been linked to a hijacking incident in the Montclair area on November 22. 
 The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Khombinkosi Jula commended the police officers on the arrests and urged the community to ensure that they report criminal activities to the police as soon as the crime is committed so that the police can immediately commence with the investigation and bring the perpetrators to book.
