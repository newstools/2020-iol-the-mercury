 "It is alleged that the woman was in an argument with her boyfriend who then proceeded to throw her off the bridge. The first priority was to secure the rescue scene for the rescuers. As volunteer rescuers and paramedics made their way to the base of the bridge to assist the victim, another team secured the anchor teams to the vehicles which would allow the rescuers to haul up the woman," he said. 

 



 

 Mathios said emergency personnel prepared a resuscitation area. 

 

 "Paramedics hoisted the woman to the top of the bridge. The critically injured patient was brought up to the top of the bridge where she was stabilised before being rushed to a Durban hospital for further care. 

 

 According to medics, the woman succumbed to her injuries and died in hospital. Meanwhile, the woman's boyfriend fled the scene and is yet to be found. 

 


 
 


 

 Mathios said police attended the scene and will be investigating further. 

 

 The incident comes just weeks after Zinhle Muthwa's battered body was found on the KZN south coast on New Year's Day. Her Metro Police officer ex-boyfriend, Constable Ndumiso Khumalo has been charged for her murder.
