  The DA’s spokesperson on health, Dr Rishigen Viranna on why they laid charges against former Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo on Wednesday. Video: Se-Anne Rall.
 


“The finding is a slap in the face for KZN’s people, who have been let down by the very people who were supposed to ensure financial accountability within the province’s health sector,” he said. 
Speaking to The Mercury, Dhlomo said he had not had time to read through the findings in the PP’s report. 

“I am busy with the parliamentary process of school opening until  Friday. I will look at that report over the weekend. Only after that maybe I will comment,” Dhlomo said.
