According to the DPCI, Better known as the Hawks, the trio introduced themselves as major generals belonging to the Hawks, who were investigating a fraud case against a prominent businessman in Kyalami, Gauteng, in May last year. The three also had an accomplice, former Durban central K9 sergeant, Bradley Matthews, 42.
