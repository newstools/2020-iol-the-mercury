Durban - A recent farm attack that left a young man in a critical condition in a KwaZulu-Natal hospital and his family severely traumatised, has renewed calls for the government to take the scourge of farm attacks seriously. "The rising violence and criminality within our country and our provinceâ€™s farming and rural communities must be a priority for government. Yet, true to the uncaring manner that we have become accustomed to, government has not shifted resources towards addressing this scourge. The President was even recorded in 2018 denying that farm safety was an issue," said Democratic Alliance KZN spokesperson on Agriculture and Rural Development, Chris Pappas. He said the victims, a young couple, were attacked in their home in Mooi River at around 8pm on Monday. Pappas said three men entered the home and severely assaulted the man. "He was taken to hospital where he received treatment for injuries sustained to his head and body. We visited the victims at hospital and they were visibly shaken," he said. Pappas said they have looked at a number of ways to beef up farm and rural safety. "We have looked at a five-pronged approach which include directly subsidising security initiatives within rural farming such as farm patrols and watches, using technology like drones and licence plate recognition cameras in rural areas, categorising farm attacks and murders as hate crimes, establishing court watching briefs to track the progress of cases and introducing properly resourced rural safety units and monitoring these through a dedicated provincial safety directorate within SAPS," he said. Pappas added that the growing number of incidents in rural and farming communities should be of concern to all. "Not only are we witnessing brutal attacks against our fellow citizens but if these trends continue our food security is also being placed at risk," he said. The Mercury
