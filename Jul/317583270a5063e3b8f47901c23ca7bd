Durban - Durban’s economy has lost an estimated R34bn and shed more than 300 000 jobs, many of them in the tourism sector, since the start of lockdown level 3 on June 1. But plans are now in place to reboot the city’s tourism market and officials are working behind the scenes to attract international tourists as soon as borders reopen. EThekwini Municipality senior manager business intelligence and product quality at Durban Tourism, Roshni Mehta, outlined these economic losses and its plans for the sector at a recent South African Association for the Conference Industry seminar in the city. Mehta said the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on the city’s economy, estimated from the number of firms reporting the impact on revenue compared with the same period last year, was a loss of R34 billion. Losses per sector were as follows: manufacturing, R10.77 billion; finance insurance and services, R5.15bn, wholesale and retail trade, R4.52bn and transport, storage and communications, R4.37bn. She said an estimated 6 346 businesses had closed. Of these 1 052 were in the manufacturing sector; 1 734 in the wholesale and retail trade and 714 were in catering, accommodation and entertainment businesses. Job losses amounted to 304 000, of which 20874 were in catering, accommodation and entertainment; 66 958 in wholesale and retail; 62 043 in finance insurance and services and 22129 in construction. “Accommodation occupancies decreased from 70% in March 2019 to 46% in March 2020. The number of visitors decreased by 36% in March and direct tourism spend by R500m,” Mehta said. She said more than 8 000 employment opportunities could be lost and it was projected that R204bn in direct tourism spend would be lost in South Africa due to the protracted lockdown. She said it was anticipated that domestic tourism would begin its recovery in December 2020/January 2021 and that international tourism would start its recovery in May 2021 following the opening of borders in February 2021. Mehta said the city was already working on restoring the local tourism sector and had provided assistance in various ways. “We have recategorised B&Bs and guest houses to residential rates, Durban Tourism is helping the tourism industry access national support and the municipality’s own accommodation bookings will now be directed to small businesses like B&Bs,” she said. She said the Durban Film Office was issuing free filming permits and the parks department was working on getting more beaches to achieve Blue Flag status. “The Treasury is looking at the implications of discounts on municipal leases in tourism spaces such as the beachfront, and Invest Durban will start a ‘buy local invest local’ campaign,” she said. Mehta said the city had also been engaging with international tour operators to attract visitors to the city and was seeking to tap young markers such as Generation Z and Generation C who were seeking specific experiences. “They are the ones who support Greenpeace, the ones who love Mandela and want to come to a country to connect and heal,” she said.
