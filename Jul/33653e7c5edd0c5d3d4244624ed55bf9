According to one of the province's police spokespersons, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, the arrest took place on Tuesday. “Police received intelligence about a suspect selling dagga at a homestead in Hlathikhulu. The team proceeded to the identified homestead where a search was conducted,” she said. According to Mbele, upon searching the home, officers found and seized two drums containing 100kg of dagga, and a plastic bag containing 30kg of dagga.
