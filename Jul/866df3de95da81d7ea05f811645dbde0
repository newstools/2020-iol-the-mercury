The residents of Aryan Benevolent Home’s old age home in Glencoe are still traumatised after armed robbers held up the facility last week. Aryan Benevolent Home is a 99-year-old national non-profit organisation that provides support for the aged, frail, physically and mentally challenged, and abused women and children. According to the home’s interim chief executive, Naren Pattundeen, since the robbery last Friday, the elderly were having difficulties sleeping owing to the trauma they experienced. Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the men robbed the employees at gunpoint before fleeing the scene. “Glencoe SAPS is investigating a case of robbery. The matter is still under investigation,” she said. Pattundeen said the men gained entry by cutting the barbed wire fence. He said they then took cash, a camera and damaged doors, cupboards and ransacked the facility. According to Pattundeen, the three armed men then held nurses at gunpoint and assaulted a staff nurse. “The residents are severely traumatised and they have had difficulty sleeping. “It is incredibly heartbreaking that people broke into our home and traumatised our elders and our nurses who are our frontline heroes. “Our dedicated staff and our distressed elderly residents have received counselling, and we pray that they will be able to heal from this awful ordeal,” said Pattundeen.
