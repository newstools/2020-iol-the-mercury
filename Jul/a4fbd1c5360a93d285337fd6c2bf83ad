Grade 12 pupils rioted on Tuesday and clashed with police, demanding that they be tested for Covid-19 after a teacher tested positive. Videos of the clash between police and pupils went viral on social media, including pictures showing injuries suffered by pupils. Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu visited the school yesterday to address teachers and pupils. “We got to know about the situation (on Tuesday), but we understand that this has been happening for the past three days. In essence, there has been a disruption of teaching and learning because of misunderstanding between teachers and pupils on how to manage positive cases of Covid-19. “The protocol from the Department of Health is that we are not testing everybody; the people who will be tested are those who have been identified as close contacts to that particular teacher,” he said. Mshengu said they were breaking with normal protocol to quickly resolve the situation at the school.
