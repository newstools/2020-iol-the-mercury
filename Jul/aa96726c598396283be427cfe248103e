Durban - Three men have been arrested in connection with ongoing cable theft in Durban's Manor Gardens area. Police said the men were nabbed and charged for being in possession of suspected stolen property. Police spokesperson, Colonel Thembeka Mbele, on Thursday officers from Mayville SAPS were conducting an operation in the area. "The operation resulted in the arrest of three men, aged between 29 and 42, for possession of suspected stolen property. Police approached a bakkie with three occupants in Manor Gardens and a search was conducted,  she said. Mbele said copper cables, three reflector jackets and various tools which included a sledgehammer, chainsaw, iron saw as well as block machine chains were recovered inside the bakkie. Mbele said the men were arrested and taken to the Mayville police station for processing. "They are expected to appear at the Durban Magistrates Court soon. Their vehicle was seized and impounded for further investigation," she said. The cables were positively identified by Telkom officials. The suspects will be profiled to ascertain if they can be linked to other cable theft cases. According to Telkom subsidiary, Openserve CEO Althon Beukes, they have noted a spike in cable theft during lockdown. In an interview with ITWeb, Beukes said since the lockdown was implemented, they had seen an increase in copper cable, theft and vandalism at several locations around the country. Beukes said affected areas included Atteridgeville, Mayfair, Newcastle, Pietermaritzburg and Tugela Ferry. He said the theft not only impated Openserve but put a strain on the communities that they serve. IOL
