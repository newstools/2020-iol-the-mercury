Department of Transport spokesperson, Kwanele Ncalane, said it was disturbing that an association leader was killed in this fashion. “It’s a bit embarrassing that we have now adjusted the regulations, and immediately as operations are resuming normally, we are again witnessing these incidents,” he said. The SA National Taxi Council conveyed its condolences to the family of the chairperson, identified only as Mr Dlamini. "We all very shocked by Mr Dlamini's murder. It's is very sad to lose leaders like him in the industry." "He was the chairperson of Fynnland Taxi Association. They are in the process of merging with Bluff Taxi Association. Although there have been challenges the two associations have been operating peacefully together for many years. His murder is unlikely to be related to the merger," a spokesperson from Santaco said.
