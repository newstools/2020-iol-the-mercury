From webinars to video conferences and family catch ups, we’ve all been relying on various forms of video chat to stay connected during the lockdown. However, not all laptops have cameras installed and let’s be honest: the camera quality isn’t super up to standard compared to other devices. Plus, they’re known to break and be temperamental at times and right now, calling an IT guy for assistance isn’t as easy as it would normally be. In order to avoid those inconvenient moments of being cut off from your virtual video world, it’s a good idea to have a backup camera on hand. And no, we don’t mean buying a whole new laptop or investing in an expensive webcam for those just-in-case instances. We’re talking about transforming your smartphone into a webcam.
