She said the centre is home to 44 vulnerable children who were rescued and taken to the Peter Pearce Centre for safety. "The property of the Comfort Child and Youth Care Centre was partially damaged by fire. I am very concerned at this incident and the extent of damage left by the fire at the children's home. We find comfort that there was no life lost in this unfortunate incident. The fire left a trail of destruction in property meant to provide shelter to the vulnerable children," she said.  Khoza said her department will work closely with law enforcement agencies, fire authorities and other experts to determine the cause of fire.
