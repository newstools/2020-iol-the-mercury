Spokesperson for Prasa in KZN Zama Nomnganga warned that train surfing killed. "We do campaigns all the time at schools and Communities but if fall on deaf ears," he said. He explained that they visited schools and spoke to pupils about the dangers of playing on top of trains, yet, pupils refused to listen. He said that during the activity of train surfing the participants compete with each other making it more dangerous.
