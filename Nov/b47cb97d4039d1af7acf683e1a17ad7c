Heavy rainfall that started earlier this month has provided much-needed relief for KwaZulu-Natal. According to Umgeni Water, rainfall recorded from November 1 to Thursday this week at measuring stations in their operational area pointed to the increasing likelihood of above-average rainfall until the end of the year. Shami Harichunder, Umgeni Water spokesperson, said the highest rainfalls during the period were at Mtwalume, on the South Coast where 325mm fell, followed by Umzinto, which received 295mm. Harichunder said good November rains on the South Coast had resulted in the three dams, Umzinto, Nungwane and EJ Smith, being full to capacity. “The December recess is just days away, and the rainfall received in October and November comes as good news for water adequacy during this period when water demand and consumption increase,” he said. Three dams in the Upper Mgeni System – Mearns, Spring Grove and Midmar – have benefited from rainfall, with Spring Grove Dam at 43%, Mearns Dam 101% and Midmar 92%. Harichunder said according to measurements from Thursday, the level of Albert Falls Dam was about 30%, Nagle Dam was 74% and Inanda Dam 83%. However,  he said Albert Falls Dam remained consistently at low levels, since the beginning of the year. That had necessitated pumping water from Inanda Dam in order to augment the water supply required for Durban.
