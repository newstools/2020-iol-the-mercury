TO commemorate Diwali, the South African Gold Coin Exchange and Scoin Shop released a medallion of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi on Tuesday. The coin, that has designs of lotus flowers, was crafted in a full ounce of pure 99.99% silver and it is available on pre-order. Lakshmi is associated with wealth, luxury, beauty, power and prosperity. “The creators at the Perth Mint in Australia have gilded Lakshmi in 24-carat gold, and the medallion’s weight and fineness are inscribed below the design with the words ‘happy’ and ‘Diwali’ on either side of the goddess,” said Rael Demby, chief executive of the South African Gold Coin Exchange and Scoin Shop. “The medal’s obverse displays a diya oil lamp surrounded by flower petals in a rangoli-inspired pattern.” He said the goddess Lakshmi symbolised luxury, beauty and prosperity. “This resonates with us, because gold and silver collectable coins embody all those qualities too. The Diwali gilded one-ounce silver medallion will appeal to Hindus and non-Hindus alike. “It’s a unique memento to mark an important Hindu holiday, but also a special addition to any numismatic collection.” Demby said, each year, they tried to produce something new to celebrate Diwali. “Last year, we did the Canadian Royal Mint Coin, and a few years back, we did the British Royal Mint. “We found that a number of our Hindu clients liked purchasing coins during Diwali to hand out to their loved ones. “We found the Lakshmi medallion through the international markets, and my staff are excited to sell because they already have their clients lined up.” Demby said the medallion was different from a coin. He explained that medallions have no face value. Demby said South Africans should consider getting into collecting coins and medallions as they could pass these down to younger generations. POST
