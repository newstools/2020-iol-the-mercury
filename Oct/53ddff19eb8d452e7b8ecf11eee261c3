THE murder of a farm foreman, Brendin Horner, 21, serves as proof that the government’s rural safety plan is failing. Horner was tortured and murdered on the farm De Rots near Paul Roux on Thursday night in the Free State. Bheki Cele recently said that “farmers must not complain if they get hurt” and it seems to suggest that the victims of farm attacks are the ones who are to blame if they become the targets of violent crime. We labelled the minister’s statement and his attitude towards the matter as incitement to violence. The senseless, cruel murder of Horner is strongly condemned and we demand that the minister must say whether Horner did indeed deserve to die in that way. The alleged murderers must be apprehended as soon as possible. Farm attacks and murders are out of control and cannot be considered ordinary crimes, particularly when the cruelty associated with these incidences is taken into account. These crimes can only be effectively combated if the government admits that they are serious, declares them to be priority crimes and establishes specialist units tasked with ensuring rural safety. We call on the agricultural community to join their safety and security structures and encourage farmers to safeguard and defend themselves. We strongly condemn the increasing anarchy in rural areas and express our deepest condolences to the friends and family of the victim.
