Durban - Ulundi residents have shut down the town and have vowed to continue with protest action until the police officers allegedly involved in the murder of a taxi driver are arrested. It is alleged that Lindani Dludla, 31, was assaulted by police officers at his home last Thursday. He was accused of having an unlicensed firearm. According to Dludla’s friend and a community leader, Siphamandla Ntombela, police allegedly assaulted Dludla and demanded he hand over the gun. Ntombela claimed the incident took place in front of Dludla’s wife and children. He said the officers assaulted Dludla until he passed out. It was also alleged that the officers took Dludla away and when he returned he was vomiting blood. The family took him to hospital, where he later died. Dludla’s death sparked anger among the community, who on Monday took to the streets and blockaded the R66 in Ulundi, demanding justice for Dludla. The town was still closed yesterday. According to the KZN Department of Transport, police arrested five people who were part of the protest. .Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) spokesperson Ndileka Cola confirmed they were investigating the death. Cola said it was alleged that police were acting on information that Dludla was in possession of an unlicensed firearm. KZN MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison Bheki Ntuli said they would not tolerate anarchy and the blockading of roads, which put further strain on an already ailing economy. “We want justice to prevail, if any police officer is found to be liable, they will face the full might of the law”, said Ntuli. Ulundi municipal manager Nkosenye Zulu also appealed to the protesters to allow Ipid to conduct its investigations. He said officials had visited the Dludla family and would assist them with the funeral arrangements. The Mercury
