Durban - THE police are out in full force in Durban  clamping down and stamping their authority on crime. This resulted in peak afternoon traffic leaving the city centre being gridlocked on Thursday. Addressing officers before the raids, the deputy commissioner for policing in KwaZulu-Natal, Major- General Thulani Gonya, instructed his members not to allow criminals to do as they pleased. He said after attending a daily provincial police meeting with cluster commanders yesterday, eThekwini was ranked first in the province for high volumes of cases reported. Roadblocks were set up at the exit points from the city on the M4 south and North, at Warwick Junction and on the M25 leading north.  Motorists caught in the traffic had their vehicles checked. In a combined effort, Durban Metro Police inspected private and public transport vehicles for road worthiness. The SAPS’ vehicle investigative unit checked for stolen or hijacked vehicles, while the rest of the team searched vehicles for illegal substances such as drugs and guns. “Often, people get killed by firearms transported on our roads. Most of the drugs are transported on our roads. It is time to put a full stop to crime.  “We must stamp our authority. We must be visible to ensure our communities are safe and secure,” Gonya said. He said he expected a results-driven operation and warned the officers not to be lacklustre, but to walk with “oomph and spring” in their steps. “These police operations can be expected to intensify until the festive season is over. We advise motorists not to drink and drive or carry any illegal substances. There will be a zero-tolerance approach.”  He said there would be an increase in police patrols and visibility in communities. Bonnets and boots were opened and checked while traffic snaked through the Durban CBD, with motorists having to switch off their cars because of over heating while stationary in the gridlock.
