Durban - Several potholes, holes and trenches have been repaired and filled around parts of the Msunduzi Municipality. Earlier today, Mayor Mzimkhulu Thebolla along with city manager Sbusiso Molefe and city officials visited sites to assess the work. According to the municipality, repairs are currently underway in Langalibalele Street, Chapel Street and in Garrick Street. "The City of Msunduzi has currently covered 1165 m2 of reinvestment waterworks and further work has resume to repair close to 30 000 m2 of potholes. The issue of potholes, cleanliness and service delivery at large remain a priority for Msunduzi Municipality and the mayor believes that the City is indeed turning the corner in most of the above priorities especially the waste management plan which is beggining to yield results and the city is getting cleaner by the day," the municipality said. In a separate issue, the municipality has come under scrutiny after it was revealed that the city had millions of rands in unclaimed deposits from ratepayers. The Mercury reported that it had a total of 12604 inactive accounts with credit balances that were older than three years, amounting to R31394800.84. It said an account became inactive when a property was sold and the seller terminated the services in their name. The Mercury also reported that city officials had been accused of abusing overtime pay by allegedly claiming millions of rands. According to the report, officials  are accused of claiming about R10 million in overtime pay between April and August. The spending has not been broken down as to which unit accumulated the most overtime, but the spending is described as part of Covid-19-related costs.
