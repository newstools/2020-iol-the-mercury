Durban - In a bid to emphasise healthcare worker safety, Durban's Ahmed Al-Kadi will transform into a tower of orange in honour of World Patient Safety Day. The event forms part of the global campaign by the World Health Organization focusing on healthcare worker safety as a pivotal pre-requisite for patient safety and urging people to show their commitment to make health care safer for all. AAK Hospital manager, Ebrahim Patel said they want to show complete support for the campaign. "We firmly believe in the campaign and this is something that we work towards on a daily basis with our focus on quality patient care," he said.   This campaign is especially special at this time as many healthcare workers died from Covid-19-related illnesses.   AAK nursing sister, Linda Lomax, said every life claimed was a tragedy and a loss to the profession. "We are extremely blessed at the AAK to not have had that experience, however, our hearts go out to those families, colleagues and friends who have. The World Health Organizationâ€™s decision to focus on healthcare worker safety as part of patient safety is welcomed with open arms," Lomax said. In addition to the light up commemorative display of support, the AAK team have coordinated some orange memoirs of the day for their peers and colleagues. According to the latest stats by the Health Ministry, 32 429 healthcare workers have tested positive for Covid-19 while 257 succumbed to the virus. The Mercury
