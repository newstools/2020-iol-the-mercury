Durban - The Newcastle Municipality is appealing for the public's assistance in tracking down a man who allegedly stole a council vacancy drop box earlier this morning. The man is believed to have stolen the box around 10:30am. According to the municipality, it is unclear if the man was working alone or had inside help. "The municipality believes that the suspect will target unsuspecting job applicants and will try to solicit money from them, for jobs in return. An investigation is currently underway," the municipality's head of communication, Mlungisi Khumalo, said. He said the man was caught on CCTV cameras and was wearing a white hat, blue jeans, black takkies and grey jersey and a yellow mask. In the video posted to the councilâ€™s Facebook page, the man is seen walking in the Newcastle Central Business District area with the box in his hand.  He also has a backpack on his back. "Members of the public with information are urged to contact the municipality or the police," he said. Khumalo added that jobs at the municipality were not for sale and that all and any suspicious activity should be reported to the Newcastle Municipality offices. The Mercury
