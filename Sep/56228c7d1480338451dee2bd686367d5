Durban – A one-week old baby was killed when the vehicle she was in veered off the roadway in the eTafuleni in Inanda on Friday morning. According to Leon Fourie of Life Response, paramedics were called out to the scene and found a Toyota bakkie with three occupants had veered off the road and rolled several times down an embankment before coming to rest against a house. "A one-week old female baby sadly passed away prior to the arrival of Life Response paramedics. “The child’s mother and father sustained serious injuries and were stabilised on scene before being transported to a nearby hospital," he said. Fourie said the cause of accident was unknown and police were investigating further. In a separate incident, a newborn was found outside a home in the Berea area on Thursday morning. Fourie said the infant was found wrapped in a green blanket and was taken to the Berea police station. “Police then called me out to have a look at the baby. I checked the baby and found that although she was healthy, she had made a poo so I changed her and swaddled her. She was handed over back to SAPS and has been taken to the Addington Hospital where she will be handed over to social workers.” Police said a resident was reversing out of his drive-way when he saw something moving in a green blanket. He then picked up the baby and took her to the police station. The Mercury
