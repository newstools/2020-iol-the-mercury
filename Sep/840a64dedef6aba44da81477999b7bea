Durban - Twelve people were killed and scores more injured in a crash on the R33 in Greytown, this morning. Netcare 911 media liaison, Shawn Herbst, said a mini-bus, truck and bakkie were involved in the crash. “Medics assessed the scene and found that twelve people had sadly lost their lives while multiple other had sustained moderate to serious injuries,” he said. Herbst added that the roadway, in both directions, have been closed to traffic in order for the necessary authorities to investigate further.   He said once all the injured have been stabilised, they will be transported by various ambulance services to nearby hospitals for further treatment. Meanwhile, those travelling along the N3 have been urged to take heed of road works along the way. Con Roux of the N3 Toll Concession (N3TC) urged motorists to familiarise themselves with any issues and plan their route before setting out. He said long distance journeys, especially at peak times, could place additional strain on motorists as roads become congested and delays are the order of the day.
