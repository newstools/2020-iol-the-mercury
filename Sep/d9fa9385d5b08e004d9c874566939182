Much of this mountain range is as wild and untouched as it was millions of years ago. Visited by thousands of hikers and climbers every year, experiencing this piece of heaven should be on every travel bucket list. Shree Ambalavaanar Alayam Temple This modest temple sits atop a slight hill in Cato Manor, Durban. A hundred glaring eyes guard the halls of Africa’s first public Hindu Temple which was originally built on the banks of the Umbilo river in 1875 by Indentured Indians. In 1947, the building was dismantled and rebuilt on its current site after a devastating flood washed most the original mud brick structure away. Annual religious festivals draw crowds in their thousands, but anyone is welcome at any time. Dingaan’s Kraal Situated in the Babanango district in Umgungundlovu, just over two and a half hours drive from Durban, this gravesite pays homage to former Zulu King Dingaan who retreated in a battle against his brother, Mpande. King Dingane was forced to flee to the Hlatikulu forests in the Lebombo mountains, where he was murdered by a group of Swazi Nyawo warriors. The gravesite is the former capital of King Dingaan’s Zulu Kingdom which lasted from 1828 to 1840. The article was written by Dominic Naidoo, the director of Travel Bug Tours.
