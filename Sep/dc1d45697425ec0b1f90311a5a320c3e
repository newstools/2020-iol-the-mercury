Durban -  KZN Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) MEC Sipho Hlomuka has deployed administrators to manage two of the provinceâ€™s embattled municipalities. Former head of department in the provincial treasury Simiso Magagula has been appointed as the new administrator of the Uthukela District Municipality, following the resignation of previous administrator Martin Sithole. Uthukela was placed under administration due to several problems, including its failure to deliver water to homes. It is also owed millions of rand for unpaid water bills, which it is failing to collect. Cogta spokesperson Senzo Mzila said Hlomuka met with the councils for Uthukela and uMzinyathi last week. Mzila said that at the uMzinyathi meeting he announced Themba Mavundla as the new administrator. Mavundla had previously served as KZN Community Safety and Liaison Department head. He takes over from Ayanda Makhanya. Umzinyathi has been under administration since 2016, following allegations of poor governance, financial mismanagement and maladministration. Hlomuka said the appointments were expected to bring expertise to the two district municipalities, which continued to face challenges in governance, financial management and service delivery. The administrators were expected to ratify decisions taken by their respective councils and ensure challenges pertaining to governance and financial management issues were addressed speedily.
